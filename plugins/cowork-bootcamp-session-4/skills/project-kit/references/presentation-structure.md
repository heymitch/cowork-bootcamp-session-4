# Presentation Structure — Client-Ready Decks

Output 2 of the Project Kit. If Gamma is connected, these become real designed slides. If not, a clean markdown outline the user can paste into any slide tool.

## Default Slide Structure (5-7 slides)

### Slide 1: Title
- Project name
- Client name + your name
- Date
- One-line hook: what this is about

### Slide 2: The Challenge
- What problem the client described
- Use their words — quotes from the meeting land harder than your summary
- Keep it to 3 bullet points max

### Slide 3: The Approach
- Your proposed solution at a high level
- Methodology or framework if you have one
- Why this approach (not others)

### Slide 4: What You'll Deliver
- Numbered deliverables
- Each with a one-line outcome (not just a task name)
- "You'll get X, which means Y"

### Slide 5: Timeline
- Visual timeline or simple phase table
- Key milestones called out
- When they'll see first results

### Slide 6: Investment
- Pricing (pulled from config.md or proposal)
- What's included
- Optional: what's NOT included (sets expectations)

### Slide 7: Next Steps
- Clear call to action
- Contact info
- "Let's start [specific date]"

## Gamma Integration

When Gamma tools are available, generate the presentation using the Gamma API:
- Use `---` as slide separators
- 5-7 slides optimal (3 minimum, 10 max)
- Let Gamma handle design — just provide clean structured content
- Request a professional theme that matches the client's industry

## Without Gamma

Output as a clean markdown outline:
```markdown
## Slide 1: [Title]
[Content]

## Slide 2: [Title]
[Content]
```

The user can paste this into Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint, or any other tool.

## Adapting by Meeting Type

### Sales/Discovery Call → Pitch Deck
Focus on: problem, solution, credibility, pricing, next steps

### Strategy Session → Roadmap Deck
Focus on: current state, vision, phases, milestones, dependencies

### Project Kickoff → Overview Deck
Focus on: scope, team, timeline, communication plan, first deliverable

# Follow-Up Email Template

Output 4 of the Project Kit. Written in the user's voice, ready to send within hours of the meeting.

## Structure

```
Subject: [Short, specific — reference the meeting topic, not "Great meeting!"]

[First name],

[Opening — reference something specific from the call. NOT "It was great to meet you." Something that shows you were listening.]

[1-2 sentences summarizing what was discussed and what was agreed.]

[Attachments/links — proposal, deck, or relevant resources]

[Clear next step — who does what by when]

[Warm close in your voice]

[Signature]
```

## Subject Line Rules

- Short: 5-9 words
- Specific: reference the topic, not the meeting itself
- Casual: sentence case, like a note to a colleague

**Good:**
- "Scope for the Q2 automation project"
- "The proposal we discussed — take a look"
- "Next steps on the content strategy"

**Bad:**
- "Great Meeting Today!"
- "Follow Up From Our Call"
- "Proposal Attached For Your Review"

## Opening Line Rules

The opening line proves you were actually in the meeting. Reference something specific.

**Good:**
- "Your point about the team being overwhelmed with manual reporting stuck with me."
- "I kept thinking about what you said re: the gap between your current process and where you want to be."

**Bad:**
- "It was great connecting with you today."
- "Thank you for taking the time to meet."
- "I really enjoyed our conversation."

## What to Attach

Based on what was generated in the Project Kit:
1. **Proposal/SOW** — always attach or link
2. **Presentation** — attach if it was a sales/discovery call
3. **Relevant resources** — case studies, examples, or links mentioned in the call

## Tone

- Written in the user's voice profile (via `<VOICE>` wrapper)
- Conversational, not corporate
- Confident, not desperate ("Here's the plan" not "I hope this works for you")
- Short — under 200 words. Respect their inbox.

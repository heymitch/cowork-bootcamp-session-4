# Proposal / SOW Template

This is the structure for Output 1 of the Project Kit. Adapt based on the meeting context — some calls need a full SOW, others just need a one-page scope summary.

## Full Proposal Structure

```markdown
# [Project Name] — Proposal

**Prepared for:** [Client Name], [Company]
**Prepared by:** [Your Name], [Your Company]
**Date:** [Date]

---

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences: What we discussed, what you'll get, why it matters. Written in your voice — not corporate boilerplate.]

## The Problem
[What challenge or opportunity came up in the meeting. Use their words where possible — direct quotes from the transcript are powerful.]

## Proposed Solution
[What you'll do. Be specific — deliverables, approach, methodology. This is the "here's how I'll solve it" section.]

### Deliverables
1. [Deliverable 1] — [one-line description]
2. [Deliverable 2] — [one-line description]
3. [Deliverable 3] — [one-line description]

## Timeline

| Phase | What | When |
|-------|------|------|
| Phase 1 | [Scope] | Week 1-2 |
| Phase 2 | [Scope] | Week 3-4 |
| Phase 3 | [Scope] | Week 5-6 |

## Investment

| Item | Price |
|------|-------|
| [Service/Deliverable] | $X,XXX |
| [Service/Deliverable] | $X,XXX |
| **Total** | **$X,XXX** |

[If pricing is in config.md, pull from there. If not, ask the user — never guess pricing.]

## Next Steps
1. Review this proposal
2. [Specific next action discussed in meeting]
3. Schedule kickoff call

## About [Your Company]
[Pull from config.md — one-liner, main offer, relevant credentials]
```

## Adapting by Context

### Quick Scope (after casual conversation)
Skip Executive Summary and About sections. Just: Problem → Solution → Deliverables → Investment → Next Steps.

### Detailed SOW (after discovery call)
Add: Success Metrics, Assumptions & Dependencies, Payment Terms, Revision Policy.

### Consulting Engagement
Add: Engagement Model (hourly vs retainer vs project), Meeting Cadence, Communication Channels.

## Where Pricing Comes From

1. **config.md** — check for pricing section, rate card, or package prices
2. **Past proposals** — if Notion connected, search for similar proposals
3. **Ask the user** — if neither source has pricing, prompt: "What should I quote for this? I can see [scope] but need your pricing."

Never fabricate pricing. Leave it as `$[TBD]` if unknown and flag it.

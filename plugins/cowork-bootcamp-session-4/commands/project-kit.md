description: Turn one meeting into a proposal, deck, social post, and follow-up email
---

Orchestrate the full project kit pipeline:

1. **Get the input** — pull transcript from Fireflies, search Gmail for meeting emails, or accept pasted notes/voice memo
2. **Generate Proposal/SOW** — scope, deliverables, timeline, pricing from config.md (references/proposal-template.md)
3. **Generate Presentation** — 5-7 slide client-ready deck via Gamma, or markdown outline if no Gamma (references/presentation-structure.md)
4. **Generate Social Content** — 1-2 LinkedIn/X posts about the project using voice profile
5. **Generate Follow-Up Email** — specific opening, summary, attachments, next step (references/follow-up-email.md)
6. **Show all 4 outputs** — wait for approval before saving or sending
7. **Save** — to Notion or local files

Run the project-kit skill with all 4 output types from a single meeting input.

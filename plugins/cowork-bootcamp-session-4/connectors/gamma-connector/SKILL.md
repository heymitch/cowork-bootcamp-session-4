# Gamma Connector

Connect your agent to Gamma so it can create presentations, documents, and webpages directly from your content.

## What Is Gamma

Gamma is a design tool that turns text into beautiful presentations, one-pagers, and webpages. Your agent writes the content, Gamma makes it look professional. No design skills needed.

## Setup

1. Go to gamma.app and create a free account
2. Get your Gamma API key from account settings (or the Gamma MCP server may handle auth)
3. Add it to Cowork Settings > Integrations, or configure the Gamma MCP server
4. Test: tell your agent "Create a test presentation in Gamma about my business"

## What Your Agent Can Do With Gamma

- Create presentations/slide decks from any text content
- Generate one-pagers and documents with professional design
- Build simple webpages from descriptions
- Choose from Gamma's theme library for styling
- Chain with other skills: meeting transcript → presentation, proposal text → pitch deck

## Skills That Use Gamma

- **Project Kit** — chains meeting transcripts → proposals → client-ready slide decks
- **Social Content** — generates carousel outlines that Gamma can design

## Troubleshooting

- Presentation looks wrong? Gamma auto-designs — if the content structure is clear (headers, bullets, sections), the output will be cleaner
- API errors? Check your Gamma plan — free accounts have generation limits

# Cowork Bootcamp — Session 4: Project Kit & Presentations

One call becomes a proposal, deck, LinkedIn post, and follow-up email. Your agent handles the packaging so you handle the relationship.

## Skills

| Skill | Say This | What Happens |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Project Kit** | "Build a project kit from my last call" | Drop a meeting transcript, brief, or voice memo — get a full project kit back: proposal/SOW with pricing, a presentation (real slides if Gamma connected, outline if not), social posts about the project, and a follow-up email ready to send. One input, four outputs. |
| **Social Content** | "Write a LinkedIn post about X" | Give it a topic, idea, or raw note — it writes platform-specific posts for LinkedIn (2,800 chars, thought leadership) or X (280 chars punchy, or 5-12 post threads). Uses your voice profile so it sounds like you, not AI. |

## Connectors

| Connector | Say This | What It Adds |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Gamma** | "Connect Gamma" | Your agent creates real presentations — not outlines, actual designed slides. Project Kit generates a client-ready deck from your meeting. Social Content can produce carousel outlines. Text in, polished visuals out. |

## Session Order

Total time: ~25 minutes.

1. **Gamma Connector** *(optional)* — connect Gamma so Project Kit generates real slides *(5 minutes)*
2. **Project Kit** — turn a recent call into a full deliverable package *(10 minutes)*
3. **Social Content** — create posts about your work to share publicly *(10 minutes)*

Project Kit is the power move of this session. You finish a sales call, say "build a project kit," and walk away with everything you need to close. Social Content lets you turn that same conversation into public thought leadership.

After this session, every meeting produces deliverables automatically. Session 5 adds landing pages.

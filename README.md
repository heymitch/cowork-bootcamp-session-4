# Cowork Bootcamp — Session 4: Project Kit & Presentations

One call becomes a proposal, deck, LinkedIn post, and follow-up email. Your agent handles the packaging so you handle the relationship.

## Skills

| Skill | Say This | What Happens |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Project Kit** | "Build a project kit from my last call" | Drop a meeting transcript, brief, or voice memo — get 4 deliverables back: **Proposal/SOW** with scope, timeline, and pricing pulled from your config. **Presentation** (real Gamma slides if connected, clean outline if not). **Social post** about the project in your voice. **Follow-up email** with a specific opening line, not "great meeting today." One input, four polished outputs. |
| **Social Content** | "Write a LinkedIn post about X" | Picks the right platform (LinkedIn, X single, thread, or carousel) and the right format style (Steps, Stats, Mistakes, Lessons, or Examples). Writes in your voice with a hook that stops the scroll. Includes a silent quality check — if it wouldn't surprise someone who's read 10 posts on the topic, it sharpens the angle before showing you. |

## Commands

| Command | Shortcut | What It Orchestrates |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Project Kit** | `/project-kit` | Runs the full 7-step pipeline: get input → proposal → presentation → social post → follow-up email → review → save |

## Connectors

| Connector | Say This | What It Adds |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Gamma** | "Connect Gamma" | Your agent creates real designed presentations — not outlines, actual slides with professional themes. Project Kit generates a client-ready deck from your meeting. Text in, polished visuals out. |

## Session Order

Total time: ~25 minutes.

1. **Gamma Connector** *(optional)* — connect Gamma so Project Kit generates real slides *(5 minutes)*
2. **Project Kit** — turn a recent call into a full deliverable package *(10 minutes)*
3. **Social Content** — create posts about your work to share publicly *(10 minutes)*

Project Kit is the power move of this session. You finish a sales call, say "build a project kit," and walk away with everything you need to close. Social Content lets you turn that same conversation into public thought leadership.

After this session, every meeting produces deliverables automatically. Session 5 adds landing pages.

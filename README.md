# Project Kit

One meeting becomes everything you need to send — extract transcripts, build proposals, generate presentations, write follow-up emails, and create social content.

## Install

Upload the ZIP via **Plugins > Upload Plugin** in Claude Cowork.

## What You Get

Install this plugin and 5 new capabilities appear in your `/` menu:

| Skill | Say This | What Happens |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Transcript Extractor** | "Pull my meeting transcript" | Finds your meeting transcript from Fireflies, Gmail, or accepts pasted notes. Extracts attendees, decisions, action items, and key quotes into a structured summary that feeds the other skills. |
| **Proposal Builder** | "Write a proposal from my meeting" | Turns meeting content into a ready-to-send proposal or SOW — complete with scope, timeline, three-tier pricing, and payment terms. Uses your business details from config.md. |
| **Deck Generator** | "Make a presentation for this project" | Creates a client-ready slide deck from your meeting content or proposal. Generates real designed slides via Gamma if connected, or a clean markdown outline for any slide tool. |
| **Follow-Up Email** | "Write a follow-up email" | Drafts a post-meeting recap email with key discussion points, action items with owners, and a clear next step. Picks formal or casual tone based on the relationship. |
| **Social Content** | "Make a LinkedIn post from my meeting" | Extracts the one valuable insight from your meeting and turns it into social content. Not "I had a great meeting" — the actual lesson or pattern worth sharing. |

The **router** runs invisibly in the background — say "build a project kit" or "turn this meeting into everything" and it chains all five skills in sequence: transcript, proposal, deck, email, social posts.

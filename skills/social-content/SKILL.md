# Social Content from Meetings

Extract the valuable insight from a meeting and turn it into social content. Not "I had a great meeting" — the actual lesson, pattern, or idea worth sharing.

## How to Run

- "Make social posts from my meeting"
- "Post about this project"
- "LinkedIn post from this call"
- "Create content from this meeting"

## What the Agent Does

### Step 1: Gather inputs

Use what's available:
- Meeting transcript or structured summary (from transcript-extractor)
- Proposal or project details (from proposal-builder)
- User-provided notes or context

Read `config.md` for voice profile, content style, and platform preferences.

### Step 2: Find the angle

Look for one of these in the meeting content:

1. **A problem worth talking about** — What was the client struggling with? Others probably have the same problem.
2. **An insight or pattern** — Did you notice something in the conversation that applies broadly?
3. **A lesson learned** — Did the meeting teach you something about your craft, your industry, or how you work?
4. **A contrarian take** — Did the conversation surface a common belief you disagree with?
5. **A framework or process** — Did you explain your approach in a way that could help others?

Pick the strongest angle. Ask if unsure: "I found a few angles — which one resonates?"

### Step 3: Write the posts

**LinkedIn post** (600-1200 characters):
- Hook: One line that stops the scroll. State the problem, the insight, or the contrarian take.
- Story: 3-5 short paragraphs. Set up the situation, share the insight, land the point.
- Takeaway: What the reader should do differently or think about.
- No hashtags in the body. 3 max at the bottom if you use them.

**X post** (under 280 characters):
- Punchy. One sharp observation or one-liner.
- If the idea needs more room, write a 3-4 tweet thread.

### Step 4: Review

Show both posts. Ask:
- "Which one do you want to post?"
- "Want me to adjust the angle or tone?"
- "Should I make this more personal or keep it general?"

## Rules

- NEVER write "I just had a great meeting with [client]." Nobody cares about your calendar.
- NEVER mention the client by name unless the user explicitly says to.
- NEVER reveal confidential project details, pricing, or business specifics.
- Extract the VALUE — the insight, the lesson, the pattern — and share that.
- Use the voice profile from config.md. If none exists, write direct and conversational.
- No AI-tell phrases: "In today's landscape", "game-changer", "leverage", "streamline."
- Show for review before posting. Never post without approval.
- One post per platform. Quality over quantity.
- If the meeting didn't produce anything worth posting about, say so. Not every meeting is content.

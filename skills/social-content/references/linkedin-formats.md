# LinkedIn Post Formats — 5 Proven Styles

Every LinkedIn post uses one of these structures. Pick based on the content.

## The 5 Styles

### 1. Steps
"How to [achieve outcome] in [timeframe]"

Structure: Hook → numbered steps (3-7) → takeaway → CTA
Best for: Teaching a process, sharing methodology, actionable advice.

### 2. Stats
"[Surprising number] — here's what it means for [audience]"

Structure: Hook with the stat → context/explanation → what to do about it → CTA
Best for: Industry data, survey results, personal metrics, benchmarks.

### 3. Mistakes
"[Number] mistakes [audience] makes with [topic]"

Structure: Hook → list mistakes with why they're wrong → what to do instead → CTA
Best for: Common pitfalls, things you've learned the hard way, client patterns.

### 4. Lessons
"[Number] lessons from [experience/timeframe]"

Structure: Hook → lessons (each 1-2 sentences) → the one that matters most → CTA
Best for: Reflections, career milestones, project post-mortems, personal stories.

### 5. Examples
"[Number] examples of [concept] in action"

Structure: Hook → concrete examples with brief analysis → pattern/insight → CTA
Best for: Case studies, before/after, showing not telling, proof of concept.

## How the Agent Picks

Match to the raw input:
- User shares a process → **Steps**
- User mentions a number or result → **Stats**
- User talks about what went wrong → **Mistakes**
- User reflects on an experience → **Lessons**
- User shows work or results → **Examples**

If unclear, present top 2 with sample hooks and let user choose.

## LinkedIn-Specific Rules

- **Max 2,800 characters.** Aim for 1,500-2,200 (sweet spot).
- **First 2 lines = the hook.** This is all they see before "see more." Make it count.
- **Line breaks between every thought.** Walls of text die on LinkedIn.
- **One idea per post.** Not three. Not five. One.
- **End with engagement.** Question, opinion prompt, or soft CTA.
- **No hashtags in the body.** 3-5 at the very end if at all.

## Content Mix (for batch generation)

When generating a week of content:
- 40% thought leadership (Steps, Lessons)
- 35% tactical (Stats, Examples)
- 25% story (Mistakes, personal narrative)

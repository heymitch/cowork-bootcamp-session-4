# Platform Rules — Format-Specific Constraints

## LinkedIn

- **Length:** ≤2,800 characters (sweet spot: 1,500-2,200)
- **Hook:** First 2 lines before the "see more" fold. Must stop the scroll.
- **Structure:** Hook → Setup → Value → Takeaway → CTA
- **Formatting:** Line breaks between thoughts. Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences). Lists for scanability.
- **Tone:** Thought leadership — teach, don't sell. Confident, not boastful.
- **CTA:** End with a question or opinion prompt ("What's your experience with this?")
- **Hashtags:** 3-5 at the very end, if at all. Never in the body.

## X / Twitter — Single Posts

- **Length:** ≤280 characters
- **Hook IS the post.** One complete thought, fully formed.
- **Tone:** Conversational, punchy, no corporate polish.
- **No hashtags** unless specifically asked.
- **No threads** for single posts — if the idea needs room, make it a thread.

## X / Twitter — Threads

- **Length:** 5-12 posts, each ≤280 characters
- **Numbering:** 1/, 2/, 3/ (not 1/X format)
- **Structure:** Hook tweet → Setup → Value delivery (1 point per tweet) → Proof → Summary → CTA
- **Each tweet stands alone** AND builds on the previous one.
- **First tweet = the hook.** It must work as a standalone viral tweet.
- **Last tweet = CTA.** Follow, retweet, reply, or link.

## LinkedIn Carousel (Text for Gamma)

- **Slides:** 3-10 (5-7 optimal)
- **Structure:** Hook slide → Problem → Solution slides → Takeaway → CTA slide
- **One idea per slide.** Big text, minimal words.
- **Font size matters** — if it can't be read on mobile, it's too small.
- Uses Gamma API if connected, markdown outline if not.

## Quality Gates (All Platforms)

Before showing any draft:
- [ ] Would this surprise someone who's read 10 posts on this topic? (Surprise Test)
- [ ] Do most sections add genuine insight? (Rate of Revelation: aim 4+/5)
- [ ] Zero AI-tell patterns: no "leverage," "synergy," "seamless," "robust," "game-changer"
- [ ] Varied sentence length (short + medium mixed, no staccato)
- [ ] Specific details over vague claims (numbers, names, examples — not "several" or "many")
- [ ] Contractions used (it's, don't, won't — not "it is," "do not," "will not")

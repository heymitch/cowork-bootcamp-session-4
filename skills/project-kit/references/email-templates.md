# Follow-Up Email Templates

Use these as starting points. Fill in the bracketed placeholders. Match tone to the relationship stage.

---

## Tone Guide

| Relationship Stage | Tone | Greeting | Sign-off |
|-------------------|------|----------|----------|
| Brand new contact | Professional, warm | Hi [NAME], | Best, [YOUR NAME] |
| After first meeting | Friendly, direct | Hey [NAME], | Talk soon, [YOUR NAME] |
| Existing client | Casual, efficient | [NAME] — | — [YOUR NAME] |
| Long-time partner | Personal, relaxed | [NAME]! | [YOUR NAME] |

### 3 Openings to NEVER Use
1. "I hope this email finds you well" — empty filler, everyone skips it
2. "Per our conversation" — sounds like a legal filing
3. "Just circling back" — passive and annoying

### Better Openings
- Reference something specific: "Loved your point about [TOPIC] yesterday."
- Jump straight in: "Here's the proposal we talked about."
- Be human: "That was a great conversation — here's what I put together."

## Template 1: New Client Follow-Up

**When:** After your first meeting with a potential client.

**Subject:** [PROJECT/TOPIC] — next steps from our call

**Body:**

Hey [THEIR_NAME],

Thanks for the conversation today. I enjoyed hearing about [SPECIFIC_THING_THEY_SAID — their challenge, project, or goal].

Here's what I'm thinking based on what you shared:

- [KEY_POINT_1 — the main problem you'd solve]
- [KEY_POINT_2 — the approach you'd take]
- [KEY_POINT_3 — the outcome they can expect]

I put together a proposal that breaks this down — scope, timeline, and pricing are all in there. [Attached / Linked below].

Take a look when you get a chance. Happy to hop on a quick call if anything needs adjusting.

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

## Template 2: Existing Client Check-In

**When:** After a project meeting or check-in with a current client.

**Subject:** Recap from today + open items

**Body:**

[THEIR_NAME] —

Quick recap from today:

**Done:**
- [COMPLETED_ITEM_1]
- [COMPLETED_ITEM_2]

**In progress:**
- [IN_PROGRESS_ITEM] — ETA [DATE]

**Need from you:**
- [ACTION_ITEM_FOR_THEM] by [DATE]

Let me know if I'm missing anything. Otherwise I'll keep moving on [NEXT_DELIVERABLE].

## Template 3: Partner / Collaboration

**When:** After an exploratory meeting about working together.

**Subject:** [THEIR_COMPANY] + [YOUR_COMPANY] — thoughts after our chat

**Body:**

Hey [THEIR_NAME],

Good talking with you about [TOPIC]. I like the idea of [SPECIFIC_COLLABORATION_ANGLE — what you'd do together].

Here's what I think could work:

[2-3 sentences on the mutual value. What they get, what you get, why it makes sense.]

If you're interested, I'd say next step is [SPECIFIC_NEXT_STEP — a short pilot, a shared project, a joint offer, etc.].

Want to set something up for next week to map it out?

Talk soon,
[YOUR_NAME]

## Template 4: Post-Presentation

**When:** After pitching to a prospect or group. Handles the "we need to think about it" response.

**Subject:** [PRESENTATION_TOPIC] — summary + next step

**Body:**

Hey [THEIR_NAME],

Thanks for having me present today. Here's a quick summary of what I covered:

**The problem:** [ONE_SENTENCE_PROBLEM]
**The solution:** [ONE_SENTENCE_SOLUTION]
**The result:** [ONE_SENTENCE_EXPECTED_OUTCOME]

I attached the [deck / proposal / one-pager] for your team to review.

I know there's a lot to consider. The one thing I'd flag: [URGENCY_OR_KEY_DIFFERENTIATOR — why acting sooner matters, without being pushy].

Happy to answer any questions your team has — just reply here or grab 15 minutes on my calendar: [CALENDAR_LINK]

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

## Template 5: Warm Re-engagement

**When:** Haven't spoken in a while. Reconnecting without being awkward about it.

**Subject:** [THEIR_NAME] — quick thought for you

**Body:**

Hey [THEIR_NAME],

Been a while — hope things are going well with [SOMETHING_SPECIFIC — their business, a project you knew about, their team].

I was [NATURAL_REASON_FOR_REACHING_OUT — working on something similar, saw their post, thought of them for a reason]. Made me think of you.

[ONE_SENTENCE_VALUE_ADD — an idea, a resource, an introduction, or an observation relevant to them.]

Would love to catch up if you have 15 minutes. No pitch — just curious what you're working on.

[YOUR_NAME]

## Rules for All Emails

1. Keep it under 200 words. Nobody reads long emails from people they just met.
2. One clear call to action. Not three options — one next step.
3. Write the subject line last, after you know the email's core message.
4. Never attach without mentioning the attachment in the body.
5. Read it once as the recipient before sending. Would you reply? Or would you archive it?

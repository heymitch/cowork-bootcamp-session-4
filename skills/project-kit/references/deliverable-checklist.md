# Deliverable Checklist

Run this before sending anything to a client, prospect, or partner. Every item. No skipping.

---

## Content Check

- [ ] Names and company spelled correctly (check LinkedIn if unsure)
- [ ] Dates and timelines are accurate and realistic
- [ ] Pricing matches what was discussed verbally (if pricing came up)
- [ ] No placeholder text remaining — search for: [TODO], [INSERT], [TBD], [YOUR], [THEIR], [X], [NAME]
- [ ] No internal notes or agent instructions visible ("Note to self", "AI should...", etc.)
- [ ] Numbers add up (if there's a pricing table, do the tiers make sense?)
- [ ] Links work (if you included any URLs, calendar links, or attachments)

## Tone Check

- [ ] Matches the relationship stage (formal for new contacts, casual for existing clients)
- [ ] Uses their language — industry terms and phrases they actually used in the meeting
- [ ] No AI-tell phrases:
  - "In today's landscape"
  - "Game-changer"
  - "Leverage" (use "use")
  - "Streamline" (use "simplify" or "speed up")
  - "Cutting-edge"
  - "Robust"
  - "Empower"
  - "Holistic"
  - "Seamless"
  - "Best-in-class"
- [ ] Sounds like a person wrote it, not a template engine
- [ ] No exclamation points in the first sentence (comes across as fake enthusiasm)

## Professional Check

- [ ] Clean format — PDF for proposals, well-formatted email for messages
- [ ] Your contact information is included (email, phone, or calendar link)
- [ ] File named professionally (e.g., "Speakeasy-Proposal-ClientName-Feb2026.pdf")
  - NOT: "draft-v3-final-FINAL.pdf"
  - NOT: "Untitled document (1).pdf"
  - NOT: "proposal.md"
- [ ] If there's a signature, it's current (title, company, contact info)
- [ ] No tracked changes, comments, or revision history visible

## Before Sending

- [ ] Read the full email / document once as if you're the recipient
- [ ] Ask: would you respond to this? Or would you archive / ignore it?
- [ ] Attachment is actually attached (the #1 most common mistake in business email)
- [ ] You're sending to the right person (check the To: field — autofill causes disasters)
- [ ] If CC'ing someone, they should be CC'd (don't CC their boss unless asked to)
- [ ] Subject line makes sense on its own (they'll see it in a notification — does it tell them what this is?)

## The 5-Second Test

Hand your deliverable to someone (or imagine handing it to someone). They glance at it for 5 seconds.

Can they answer:
1. **What is this?** (proposal, email, presentation)
2. **Who is it from?** (your name, your company)
3. **What do I need to do?** (review, sign, reply, pay)

If the answer to any of those is "I'm not sure" — reformat before sending.

## Common Mistakes (Ranked by Embarrassment Level)

1. **Wrong name** — You called them "Sarah" and their name is "Sara." Relationship damaged.
2. **Forgot attachment** — "Please find attached..." with no attachment. Now you send a second email that says "oops, here it is" and look disorganized.
3. **Leftover placeholders** — "[INSERT COMPANY NAME]" sitting in the middle of a proposal. Shows you didn't read your own work.
4. **Wrong pricing** — You said $5,000 on the call and the proposal says $7,500. Trust broken.
5. **AI artifacts** — "As an AI language model" or "Here's a professional email for you" left in the document. Instant credibility loss.
